# CS231
Stanford's Deep ConvNets course

These are the code exercises that Stanford kindly has available for its CS231 course at https://cs231n.github.io/ and https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3FW7Lu3i5JvHM8ljYj-zLfQRF3EO8sYv and that I audited and carried out on my own. Big big thanks to Stanford and these great teachers in particular <3! Please reach me out if you find any mistakes.

I may also be able to upload in the future some experiments on my own or implementations of algorithms beyond this course like Mask-RCNN or others.
